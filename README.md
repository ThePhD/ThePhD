# What I Do ‚úç

I make the fastest things go faster, the unsafe things much safer, and the difficult things easy to do!

I specialize in ergonomic library design, performance tuning, foreign function/language interfaces, and a little bit of graphics programming. My favorite work includes programming that enables even the newest programmers to produce high-quality code that pushes them and others towards the pit of success! Occasionally, I get stuck in a Network Programming loop üí´!

I also do [Diversity and Inclusivity work in the technical space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLKm9FE8oo), working towards making a better and more equitable environment for everyone's contributions.
