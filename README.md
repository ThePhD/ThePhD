# What I Do ‚úç

I make the fastest things go faster, the unsafe things much safer, and the difficult things easy to do!

I specialize in ergonomic library design, performance tuning, foreign function/language interfaces, and a little bit of graphics programming. My favorite work includes programming that enables even the newest programmers to produce high-quality code that pushes them and others towards the pit of success! Occasionally, I get stuck in a Network Programming loop üí´!

I also do [Diversity and Inclusivity work in the technical space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLKm9FE8oo), working towards making a better and more equitable environment for everyone's contributions.




# Need Something Done? ‚úî

I perform exceedingly well at connecting disparate systems together to provide you with a painless developer experience, whether by libraries or scripting interfaces. I use a lot of C++ and C, but I also spend my time doing C#, Rust, JavaScript + Typescript, OCaml, a tiny bit of Haskell when I can wrap my head around the many many operators, and HTML/CSS work. I also have plenty of experience shaping good user interfaces to improve the end user's experience, driving positive customer experience for better retention.

I'm available from _January 2021_ and onward for intensive projects, and there's plenty of room for open source support right now!

For support and support contracts in:

- Open Source work, e.g.:
	- [sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2)
	- [itsy.bitsy](https://github.com/ThePhD/itsy_bitsy)
	- and others...
- Standardization work, e.g.:
	- [WG14 and WG21 proposals](https://ThePhD.github.io/portfolio/standard)

please [reach out](https://soasis.org/contact/opensource/)! I'll be happy to make custom solutions using open source tools for your needs, support a specific feature set in a library (mine or others), or carry through a specific proposal in the standardization process [like I have done for others](https://twitter.com/__phantomderp/status/1325853307307438081).
